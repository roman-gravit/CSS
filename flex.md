# Flexbox


### Concepts ###

The flexible box layout module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, 

and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. 

When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes â€” the **main axis** and the **cross axis.** 

The main axis is defined by the **flex-direction** property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. 

Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.

 - Elements sizing and ordering

 - Horizontal and vertical alignment

 - Empty space between elements

 - Positioning 


#### Container Properties ####

 - **flex-direction:**  row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse

 - **flex-wrap:** nowrap | warp | wrap-reverse
                  Whether flex items are forced onto one line(default) or can wrap onto multiple lines
			      Note: Top-bottom margins **do NOT collapsed** in flexbox.

 - **flex-flow:** This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties: flex-direction and flex-wrap

 - **gap:**       0 | px | % | em | calc() 
                  Precise: column-gap | row-gap
                  Sets the gaps (gutters) between rows and columns 

 - **justify-content:**  flex-start | center | flex-end | space-between | space-around | space-evenly. 
                         Align items along the **main-axis.**

 - **align-items:**  stretch(default) | center | flex-start |  flex-end | baseline. 
                     Align items along the **cross-axis.** 

 - **align-content:**  stretch(default) | flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around. For multiline alignment.
                       **Will work only if flex-wrap = wrap**
    

#### Item Properties ####

 - **align-self:**    stretch(default) | center | flex-start | flex-end

 - **flex-grow:**     N: Specifies how much of the flex container's **remaining space** should be assigned to the flex item.

 - **flex-shrink:**   N: Sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item.

 - **flex-basis:**    auto | 0 | px | rem | em.  Sets the initial main size of a flex item. **Only for main-axis**

 - **flex:**          Shorthand property for: flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis

 - **order:**         N: Sets the order to lay out an item in a flex or grid container. 
                      (Default:0). Can be minimum.
